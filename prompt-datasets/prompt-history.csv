"give me step by step guide to learn the expressjs","I want to learn Express.js, a popular Node.js framework for building web applications. I've heard it's a great tool for creating robust and scalable server-side applications, but I'm not sure where to start. Can you provide a step-by-step guide on how to learn Express.js, including the basics, routing, middleware, templates, databases, authentication, and deployment? I'd like to know what tools and software I'll need, what resources are available to help me learn, and what kind of projects I can build with Express.js. I'm a beginner, so please assume I have no prior knowledge of Express.js or Node.js. 

I've uploaded some files that may be relevant to my learning process, can you please refer to them as well. 

Please provide a detailed guide that covers the following topics: 
1. Introduction to Express.js and its features
2. Setting up a new Express.js project
3. Understanding the basics of Express.js, such as routing, middleware, and templates
4. Working with databases and models in Express.js
5. Implementing authentication and authorization in Express.js
6. Deploying an Express.js application to a production environment
7. Troubleshooting and debugging common issues in Express.js

I'd like to learn by building real-world projects, so please provide some examples of projects I can build with Express.js, such as a simple web server, a RESTful API, or a full-stack web application. 

I'm looking for a comprehensive guide that will take me from beginner to advanced level, so please include as much detail as possible. 

Also, I'd like to know what are the best practices for building scalable and secure Express.js applications, and how to optimize the performance of my application. 

Please provide a step-by-step guide that includes code examples, screenshots, and diagrams to help me understand the concepts better. 

I'm excited to learn Express.js and build amazing web applications, so please help me get started!","yes","user like the format and got a better result"
"give me step by step guide to learn the expressjs","I want to learn Express.js from scratch, can you provide a step-by-step guide on how to get started, including the prerequisites, setting up the development environment, and a comprehensive overview of the framework, covering topics such as routing, middleware, request and response objects, template engines, database integration, authentication and authorization, error handling, and best practices for building scalable and secure applications, also considering the uploaded files, I need a detailed explanation of each concept with examples and use cases, and how to apply them in real-world scenarios, including common pitfalls and troubleshooting techniques, and finally, how to deploy and maintain an Express.js application in a production environment.","no"
"how to do RBAC in next js 14 with firebase auth with only middelware and no external libraries. remember next js has a dumb client side router cache that skips the middleware bypassing our auth check!","I'm trying to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in a Next.js 14 application that uses Firebase Auth for authentication, and I want to achieve this using only middleware and without relying on any external libraries. However, I'm facing an issue due to Next.js's client-side router cache, which can bypass my auth checks by skipping the middleware. 

To set up RBAC, I need to assign roles to users and restrict access to certain routes based on these roles. I've uploaded some files that contain more details about my project structure and the specific requirements I'm trying to meet. 

Can you provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement RBAC in Next.js 14 using Firebase Auth and middleware, while also addressing the issue of the client-side router cache bypassing my auth checks? 

Specifically, I'd like to know how to: 
1. Authenticate users with Firebase Auth in a Next.js middleware function.
2. Assign and verify user roles in the middleware function.
3. Restrict access to specific routes based on user roles.
4. Ensure that the client-side router cache does not bypass my auth checks, potentially by using a specific configuration or workaround in Next.js 14. 

Please provide a detailed explanation of the process, including any relevant code snippets or examples, to help me implement RBAC in my Next.js application using only middleware and Firebase Auth.","yes","user get a better result"
"we are creating a custom AI linkedin DM post via prosper AI.

i will give you a DM context, add the AP prompt with these variables
Hi Rick,
I saw your profile and was interested to learn more about Unrivaled Sports. Iâ€™m with a venture studio partners with growth-stage companies to scale products and explore new opportunities.
Would love to see if we can collaborate 

variables
{{Company name}}{{Company Overview}}{{First name}}{{job title}}","I'm trying to craft a personalized LinkedIn DM post using Prosper AI, and I need help with the prompt. The goal is to reach out to a specific individual, express interest in their company, and explore potential collaboration opportunities. The post should be addressed to the person's first name, mention their company name, and provide a brief overview of their company. I also want to mention my job title and the fact that I'm with a venture studio that partners with growth-stage companies to scale products and explore new opportunities. The variables that need to be included in the prompt are the company name, company overview, first name, and job title. The prompt should be structured as a personalized message, starting with a greeting and introducing myself and my interest in the company, followed by a brief description of my venture studio and its goals, and ending with an expression of interest in collaborating. The prompt should look something like this: 
Hi {{First name}}, I came across your profile and was impressed by {{Company name}} and its work in {{Company Overview}}. As a {{job title}} with a venture studio, I partner with growth-stage companies to scale products and explore new opportunities, and I think our goals might align. Would love to discuss potential collaboration opportunities and see if we can work together to drive growth.","no","user got wrong response when he used the AI generated prompt"
"I want to convert riv files to some format which I can use in figma. How can I do it? I want the answers in simple step by step process","I have some RIV files that I want to use in Figma, but Figma doesn't support RIV files directly. To convert RIV files to a compatible format, I need to follow these steps:

1. Open the RIV file in a 3D modeling software that supports RIV files, such as Blender or Autodesk Maya, or use an online 3D model converter.
2. Export the 3D model from the software as a 2D vector file, such as SVG or EPS, or as a raster image file, such as PNG or JPEG.
3. If the exported file is a raster image, I may need to use a vectorization tool, such as Adobe Illustrator or an online vectorizer, to convert it into a vector format.
4. Import the converted file into Figma, either by dragging and dropping the file into Figma or by using the "Import" feature.

I've uploaded some sample RIV files, and I'd like to know the best way to convert them into a format that Figma can use. Can you provide more information on the specific software or tools I can use for each step, and any settings or configurations I should use to ensure the best results? 

Additionally, I'd like to know if there are any online tools or services that can simplify the conversion process, and if there are any specific considerations I should keep in mind when converting 3D models to 2D formats for use in Figma.","no","the user got very lengthy result, he needs step by step short answers for the implementaion guide"
